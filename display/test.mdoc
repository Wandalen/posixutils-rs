Sh block: Fromated In macro The
Sh block: Fromated In macro access()
Sh block: Fromated In macro function checks the accessibility of the file named by
Sh block: Fromated In macro path
Sh block: Fromated In macro for the access permissions indicated by
Sh block: Fromated In macro amode.
Sh block: Fromated In macro The
Sh block: Fromated In macro amode
Sh block: Fromated In macro argument is either the bitwise OR of one or more of the access permissions
Sh block: Fromated In macro to be checked
Sh block: Fromated In macro (
Sh block: Fromated In macro R_OK
Sh block: Fromated In macro for read permission,
Sh block: Fromated In macro W_OK
Sh block: Fromated In macro for write permission, and
Sh block: Fromated In macro X_OK
Sh block: Fromated In macro for execute/search permission) or the existence test,
Sh block: Fromated In macro F_OK.
Sh block: Fromated In macro All components of the pathname
Sh block: Fromated In macro path
Sh block: Fromated In macro are checked for access permissions (including
Sh block: Fromated In macro F_OK).
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro The real user ID is used in place of the effective user ID
Sh block: Fromated In macro and the real group access list
Sh block: Fromated In macro (including the real group ID) is
Sh block: Fromated In macro used in place of the effective ID for verifying permission.
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro If the invoking process has superuser privileges,
Sh block: Fromated In macro access()
Sh block: Fromated In macro will always indicate success for
Sh block: Fromated In macro R_OK
Sh block: Fromated In macro and
Sh block: Fromated In macro W_OK,
Sh block: Fromated In macro regardless of the actual file permission bits.
Sh block: Fromated In macro Likewise, for
Sh block: Fromated In macro X_OK,
Sh block: Fromated In macro if the file has any of the execute bits set and
Sh block: Fromated In macro path
Sh block: Fromated In macro is not a directory,
Sh block: Fromated In macro access()
Sh block: Fromated In macro will indicate success.
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro The
Sh block: Fromated In macro faccessat()
Sh block: Fromated In macro function is equivalent to
Sh block: Fromated In macro access()
Sh block: Fromated In macro except that where
Sh block: Fromated In macro path
Sh block: Fromated In macro specifies a relative path,
Sh block: Fromated In macro the file whose accessibility is checked is determined relative to
Sh block: Fromated In macro the directory associated with file descriptor
Sh block: Fromated In macro fd
Sh block: Fromated In macro instead of the current working directory.
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro If
Sh block: Fromated In macro faccessat()
Sh block: Fromated In macro is passed the special value
Sh block: Fromated In macro AT_FDCWD
Sh block: Fromated In macro (defined in
Sh block: Fromated In macro )<fcntl.h>
Sh block: Fromated In macro in the
Sh block: Fromated In macro fd
Sh block: Fromated In macro parameter, the current working directory is used.
Sh block: Fromated In macro If
Sh block: Fromated In macro flag
Sh block: Fromated In macro is also zero, the behavior is identical to a call to
Sh block: Fromated In macro access(.)
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro The
Sh block: Fromated In macro flag
Sh block: Fromated In macro argument is the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following values:
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE     AT_EACCESSNEWLINE          The checks for accessibility are performed using the effective userNEWLINE          and group IDs instead of the real user and group IDs.NEWLINENEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro If
Sh block: Fromated In macro path
Sh block: Fromated In macro cannot be found or if any of the desired access modes would not be granted,
Sh block: Fromated In macro then a -1 value is returned; otherwise a 0 value is returned.
Sh block: Fromated In macro Access to the file is denied if:

Sh block: Fromated In macro Additionally,
Sh block: Fromated In macro faccessat()
Sh block: Fromated In macro will fail if:

Sh block: Fromated In macro The

Sh block: Fromated In macro access()
Sh block: Fromated In macro first appeared as an internal kernel function in
Sh block: Fromated In macro Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
Sh block: Fromated In macro It became a system call,
Sh block: Fromated In macro first appearing outside of Bell Labs in the
Sh block: Fromated In macro “50 changes”
Sh block: Fromated In macro tape for
Sh block: Fromated In macro Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
Sh block: Fromated In macro The first official release with the system call was PWB/UNIX 1.0.
Sh block: Fromated In macro It was also included in
Sh block: Fromated In macro 2BSD.
Sh block: Fromated In macro NEWLINE NEWLINE
Sh block: Fromated In macro The
Sh block: Fromated In macro faccessat()
Sh block: Fromated In macro function appeared in
Sh block: Fromated In macro OpenBSD 5.0.
Sh block: Fromated In macro access()
Sh block: Fromated In macro and
Sh block: Fromated In macro faccessat()
Sh block: Fromated In macro should never be used for actual access control.
Sh block: Fromated In macro Doing so can result in a time of check vs. time of use security hole.
