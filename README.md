# posixutils-rs

This is a suite of Rust-native core command line utilties (cp, mv, rm,
ls, ...) using SuSv3 as the base POSIX specification.

## Goals

The goal is to create clean, race-free userland utilities that are POSIX
compliant, maximizing compatibility with existing shell scripts while
minimizing bloat.

Implementation goals include clean, safe Rust code and maximal use of
Rust community crates.  This project's utilities should "look like
normal Rust programs."

Contributions are welcome.  Developers and helpers, please read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Core specification: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/

### Non-goals

It is _not_ a goal to be compatible with GNU utilities, which are
sometimes viewed as bloated and overloaded with rarely-used options.

Popular GNU options will be supported by virtue of the "don't break
scripts" rule.  Unpopular options will not be implemented, to prevent
bloat.

## Testing

A few tests require additional setup such as a case-insensitive filesystem or the use of another command like [script](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html). They are locked under the `posixutils_test_all` feature flag to exclude them from GitHub CI. These tests can be run by passing the feature flag to `cargo`:

```sh
cargo test --release --features posixutils_test_all
```

A further subset of `posixutils_test_all` tests are marked as `requires_root`. Running as root would override Unix permissions and thus give false failures on tests where such permissions are expected to be upheld so it is recommended to run these tests individually. There are currently two such tests:

- test_cp_special_bits
- test_mv_sticky_to_xpart

```sh
sudo -E cargo test --release --features posixutils_test_all,requires_root <test_name>
```

Integration tests may generate test data under `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` (usually resolves to `target/tmp`) and `/dev/shm` (Linux only).
